- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EthanReed517
- Most of my work is related to projects on MarvelMods.com, a site where we make mods for X-Men Legends, X-Men Legends II, Ultimate Alliance, and other games.
- I do a lot of work with batch files and GIMP python scripts to create utilities that others can use to mod their games more easily.
